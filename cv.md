### English 
My English level is pre-intermediate. I have studied with textbooks and practiced by watching movies, listening to podcasts, and following English radio. Also, all the technical documents I use are in English, which has improved my reading and understanding for work. I am continuing to study on my own, and as soon as financially possible, I plan to work with a tutor to reach at least a B2 level.
